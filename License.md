## Spearmint Custom License, Version 1.0

Permission is herby granted free of charge with the “Software” (the product) alongside with the documentation files that come alongside with the “Software”. With the Spearmint Custom License, you are, as a result of this “License”, allowed to view, use, and modify the “Software”. Yet, you are subjected to the following terms and restrictions:

### Forking

With the Spearmint Custom License, you hereby obtain the right to fork any official copies of the “Software”, yet it must include at least a single feature inclusion or better for the "Software". On that note, any modification to the “Software” must be accompanied with the inclusion of additional documentation describing the purpose of your modification. Accompanying modifications, your modification of the “Software” must exhibit meaningful effort; signifying that any “low-quality” or “cheap” modifications to the “Software” are not allowed.

### Distribution

Redistribution of the “Software” is not allowed. In order to obtain a secondary or “backup” copy of the “Software”, you must officially obtain the “Software” from the initial and original source of the “Software”. This is to prevent false integrity being spread within the universe of said “Software”.

### Attribution

Any modifications to the “Software” must retain this “License” and include clear yet extensive attribution to the original author, (author name), and (project name). This “License” does grant the permission to hand over the developmental and stable source code including internal and experimental documentation to a separate organization or person who has been granted the right to take ownership of the “Software”.

### Prohibited Uses

The “Software” or any somewhat related forks may not be used in any project or manner that misrepresents or misinterprets the values of any Spearmint Resources. Examples of this include adding an unrelated image of an object to the “Software”, and that is a single example.

### Branding

Any uses of the “Spearmint” or “Spearmint OS” branding in an unauthorized manner may result in a public blacklisting to the “Software” alongside removal of access to any additional repositories for official versions of the “Software”. Keep in mind that any violations of the “License” will be in result of such stated above.

## Disclaimer

The “Software” is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The author shall not be liable for any claims or damages arising from the use or misuse of the “Software”.
