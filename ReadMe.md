# Spearmint OS - Window System
Spearmint OS is an Operating System with three foremost goals, all being "Minimalist", "Simplistic", and "Forthright" in the minimalist aspect, both internally and externally. The external part being related to aspects such as user interface design, user experience design, along with other essential or miscellaneous aspects. In this case, "minimalist aesthetics" referring to beautiful, neomorphic, and simple-to-create user interfaces. This is where the Spearmint  Window System comes into play.

The Spearmint Window System aims to be a simplistic, lightweight, yet functional Window System with both a full-screen mode and a draggable-window mode. Each having their advantages and disadvantages.

## Purpose
There is a simplistic, mere purpose of the Spearmint Window System, that is, not having to constantly create brand new window elements each time, including the entire window itself.

## Changelog
* [Wednesday, December 18th, 2024] ~ [Attempted to develop a functional prototype of such Window System. Due to accidental deletion of such Window System, I couldn't recover it.]
* [Thursday, December 19th, 2024] ~ [Re-Attempted to create a functional prototype, with full-screen and windowed mode. Successful, with a few minor features that weren't included such as windows (when going back to their normal state after maximizing) not going back to their initial spot, but going to the center of the virtual display.]
* [Tuesday, December 24th, 2024] ~ [Decided to scrap this project, as it really had no use within Spearmint OS, only being a sophisticated window manager. It was against the ethos of Spearmint OS, so it will be scrapped yet archived.]
